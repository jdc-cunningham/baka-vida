Going to see if I can code... been getting harder and harder has since I don't do it so much anymore

The thing is I still don't know what this app should do, I see some designs in my mind here and there

I have to rework the data store too it works from that tutorial but I just copied/pasted it, gotta organize the code

I have been struggling with motivation to write code for myself

This is one of the most recent things I've been working on

Haven't worked on a hardware project in a bit

I just feel occupied with the feeling of dread lately or working since I work everyday

Trying to apply to jobs but low hopes

Clock is ticking on my debts

I'm going to force myself to write this code, I got some sleep and my caffeine

Going to add local data store with sqlite

I don't want my "weekend" to feel wasted

Damn that was a struggle, I feel dumb now ha, not sure if that's what happens when you haven't worked in this field for 9 months/worked in labor instead

Still trying to get motivation on this, what do I want it to do...

I have what I need to know to make it, just do it...

I keep wondering if it's a waste of time to work on this project

I use the color notes widget more to write things down

I keep seeing little functionalities I want like a "target money to make" bar where I put in what I made for the day

Idk just things to keep me going

Trying to get myself to add sqlite https://blog.logrocket.com/using-sqlite-react-native/

Trying to get motivation I have little free time, trying to make progress on something that feels worth it

Alright gonna put some time into this, I have 5 more hours till I have to do more deliveries

I'm going to get data storage working

Replace the hardcoded stuff as a new schema/db entry

damn I can't focus on this right now
