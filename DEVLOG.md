I keep wondering if it's a waste of time to work on this project

I use the color notes widget more to write things down

I keep seeing little functionalities I want like a "target money to make" bar where I put in what I made for the day

Idk just things to keep me going

Trying to get myself to add sqlite https://blog.logrocket.com/using-sqlite-react-native/

Trying to get motivation I have little free time, trying to make progress on something that feels worth it

Alright gonna put some time into this, I have 5 more hours till I have to do more deliveries

I'm going to get data storage working

Replace the hardcoded stuff as a new schema/db entry
